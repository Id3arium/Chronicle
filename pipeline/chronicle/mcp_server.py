    """Search Alejandro's Chronicle — a personal encyclopedia of his past
    claude.ai conversations, stored as markdown summaries with metadata.

    HOW TO USE RESULTS:
    - Always present a condensed list of the top results to Alejandro
      (one line each: date, title, score). He wants to see what matched —
      important topics often span multiple conversations.
    - Then call chronicle_read on the top hit(s) to read the full summary
      and answer the question.
    - Quote specific passages from summaries, don't paraphrase loosely.

    SEARCH TIPS:
    - Use 1–3 specific terms. "Michael Levin" beats "biology". Rare terms
      score higher (IDF weighting).
    - Multiple terms narrow results: "levin morphogenesis" scores
      conversations matching both terms much higher.
    - Keywords include associated domains, so "levin" finds bioelectricity
      conversations even if that word wasn't the search term.

    COVERAGE: Chronicle only contains conversations that were downloaded
    and processed. It is NOT a live mirror of claude.ai. If no results,
    say "no matches in Chronicle" — NOT "you never discussed X." The
    conversation may exist but not be ingested yet.

    VOCABULARY:
    - FOP = Fractal Organization Principle (Alejandro's framework)
    - STRC/MSTX = trading structures Alejandro built
    - Don't guess at acronyms — ask or leave verbatim
    - Summaries refer to Alejandro as "you" or by name, never "the user"

    Args:
        query: Space-separated search terms. 1-3 specific terms work best.
        significance: Filter by "high", "medium", or "low". Optional.
        from_date: Restrict to conversations on/after this day, YYYY-MM-DD (or
            "now"). Use with to_date for "between X and Y". Optional.
        to_date: Restrict to conversations on/before this day, YYYY-MM-DD (or
            "now"). Defaults to today, so from_date alone means "since X".

    Each row: occurrence count · first-seen → last-seen · theme. The count
    is how MANY conversations touched it (corpus presence); the span tells

    - High count = a trunk-line you keep working (e.g. FOP, consciousness).
      Follow it DEEPER with chronicle_find / chronicle_cards.
    - A theme whose last-seen is months old = possibly resolved, or a
      dropped thread worth picking back up.
    - Range across the list, don't just take the top — the thin,
      recently-touched themes are often the more interesting revisit.

    chronicle_read (the whole summary). Use it to BROWSE many conversations
    at once and decide which one to drill into — then chronicle_read its
    summary_file, or chronicle_passage the transcript.

    1. BY UUID LIST — pass `uuids` (full or prefix) to pull cards for a
       specific shortlist. Ideal right after chronicle_find: grab the cards
       for the top hits to compare their topics/keywords side by side
       before committing to read one.

    2. BY FILTER — pass any of `period`, `from_date`/`to_date`, `project`,
       `significance` to list all matching cards. Good for serendipitous
       revisiting, e.g. chronicle_cards(period="2025_Q3", significance="high")
       to surface past high-significance conversations worth a second look.

    Scope by time with EITHER period (a named label) OR from_date/to_date (an

    Use after reading a summary when you need the EXACT words — direct
    quotes, precise phrasing, the actual back-and-forth. Messages are
    numbered by position (0-based) and always returned in chronological
    order.

    TWO MODES:

    1. KEYWORD SEARCH — pass `query`. Finds every message containing any
       of the keywords, in chronological order, and returns the first
       `limit` of them (default 10). The FIRST hit in the output is the
       first occurrence in the conversation. Each result is labelled with
       its position, e.g. "message 40/124".

       → "Find the first occurrence of X" = call with query=X; the first
         result is the answer.

    2. INDEX LOOKUP — pass `index` to fetch a specific message by
       position. Optionally add `before=N` and/or `after=N` to include
       neighbouring messages — DIRECTIONALLY. Each is capped at 5.
         before=5  → the 5 messages before index (the lead-up)
         after=5   → the 5 messages after index (what followed)
       Default before=0, after=0 returns just that one message.

    Typical flow for "find first occurrence, then show what led up to it":
      a. chronicle_passage(conv, query="the phrase")
         → first hit is at, say, message 40.
      b. chronicle_passage(conv, index=40, before=5)
         → messages 35–40, the lead-up (you already have 40, so it's the
           tail of this range).
    To see what came AFTER instead, use after=5. To see both sides, set
    both. Pull only the direction you need; widen only if it's not enough.

    Args:
        conversation: Which conversation to read. Easiest: pass the UUID
            from chronicle_find / chronicle_cards (full or just the first
            8 chars). It also accepts whatever path those tools gave you —
            a summary file ("summaries/.../27_markets__322ed80e.md"), a
            conversation file, or a bare filename — and resolves it to the
            transcript. When in doubt, pass the UUID.
        query: Space-separated keywords. Matches any message containing
            ANY keyword (case-insensitive). Provide query OR index.
        index: Message position (0-based) to retrieve. Provide query OR index.
        before: In index mode, also include this many messages BEFORE
            `index` (the lead-up). Default 0. Capped at 5.
        after: In index mode, also include this many messages AFTER
            `index` (what followed). Default 0. Capped at 5.
        limit: In keyword mode, max matching messages to return (default 10).
